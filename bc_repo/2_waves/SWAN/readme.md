## Cockburn Sound model : waves (SWAN) boundary condition files

<br>

This folder contains the outputs from the SWAN (Simulating WAves Nearshore) model, originally developed by BMT and processed for use by the TUFLOW-FV Cockburn Sound model.

The files include wave variables specific to the CSIEM model domain.

Files in this folder include (by Apr 2023):

```
SWAN_A_HIND_UTC+8_20130101_20131231.nc
SWAN_B_HIND_UTC+8_20130101_20131231.nc
SWAN_C_HIND_UTC+8_20130101_20131231.nc
```

Note that three resolutions are available and processed, which cover different regions of model domain. The finest resolution (SWAN_C_HIND) covers the Cockburn Sound area of interest.

These files are not stored in GitHub and can be accessed from the CSIEM model archive on Pawsey:

```
